Basis-Training
==============

A batch of basis exercises make you can get familiar with one language. I will use Python but you can solve them with any other languages(See [solutions](https://github.com/hsssgddtc/Basis-Training-Solutions)). 

##Structure
This project will be divided into below categories. You can find each category in its own folder.  
1. Numbers  
2. Strings  
3. Arrays  
4. Branch   
5. Loops  
6. Math  
7. Recursion  
8. Order  
9. Class

##Details
- I may not complete all of them.  
- My method may not be the best. If you have better ways to solve them. Please open an issue and add your comment. I will try to improve.

Numbers
------------
**General Exercise** - Write a program, define the constant Pi=3.1415926, define 3 variables in Double type, assign them value from keyboard input(judge the input type, report an error if not numbers), take them as the radius r of three circles.  
1. Find out the area of three circles. Print in one column and make the decimal point align. Keep 3 digits.  
2. Find out the circle with maximum area, round-up and print its area.  
3. Print the area of three circles in descent orders.  
4. Set the height of cylinder h=3.6, bottom radius is the radius of the circle with minimus area. Try to find out the circumference and cylindrical volume. Print out them with description and keep 2 digits.
