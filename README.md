Basis-Training
==============

A batch of basis exercises make you can get familiar with one language. I will use Python but you can solve them with any other languages(See [solutions](https://github.com/hsssgddtc/Basis-Training-Solutions)). 

##Structure
This project will be divided into below categories. You can find each category in its own folder.  
1. Numbers  
2. Strings  
3. Arrays  
4. Branch   
5. Loops  
6. Math  
7. Recursion  
8. Order  
9. Class

##Details
- I may not complete all of them.  
- My method may not be the best. If you have better ways to solve them. Please open an issue and add your comment. I will try to improve.

Numbers
------------
**General Exercise** - Write a program, define the constant Pi=3.1415926, define 3 variables in Double type, assign them value from keyboard input(judge the input type, report an error if not numbers), take them as the radius r of three circles.  
1. Find out the area of three circles. Print in one column and make the decimal point align. Keep 3 digits.  
2. Find out the circle with maximum area, round-up and print its area.  
3. Print the area of three circles in descent orders.  
4. Set the height of cylinder h=3.6, bottom radius is the radius of the circle with minimus area. Try to find out the circumference and cylindrical volume. Print out them with description and keep 2 digits. 

**Factorial Calculation** - Input a positive integer n and calculate the result of 1!+2!+3!+......+n!. Use both recursion and loops.

**Prime or Not** - For the number between 101 and 200. Judge if it's prime number or not. If not, print all its positive divisor.

**Greatest and Least** - Input two integer m and n, findout their greatest common divisor and least common multiple.

**Combination** - We have numbers 1,2,3,4. How many different three-digit numbers can they combined without duplicate digits.Print them all.

**Binary Decimal Converter** - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

**Palindrome or Not** - Let user input a number and return a result if this number is a palindrome number or not.

**Narcissistic Number** - Narcissistic Numbers, is defined as a three-digits-number, summary of each number's cube is the Narcissistic Numbers itself. For example, 153 is a Narcissistic Numbers, cause 153=1^3+5^3+3^3. Print all Narcissistic Numbers in a column.

**Perfect Number** - If a number exactly equals the summary of its proper factor, we call it perfect number. Such as 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. Write a program and print all perfect number under 1000.

**Find Pi** - Find out the value of π use below formulas: π = 4 * (1/1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...), until the absolute value of the last item less than 0000001.
